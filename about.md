Software engineer, programmer with a focus in AI and Machine learning. His number one loved theorem is the Bayes Theorem.

it basically says that newer evidence can change how sure we're for our beliefs. We don't have to trust anything. We just have to keep incorporating new data. And we mustn't be sure of anything. We just have to keep multiple levels of beliefs. For example I believe the "no one is out to get me" statement by 34% and yesterday's evidence changed my beliefs to 33.8%. from 32% last week. It's a very simple notion and rule and it is behind many of our technologies like self driving cars and modern AI systems (google).

**Extended form of Bays Rule:**

$$\boxed{P(A_k | B ) = \frac{P(B|A_k) P(A_k)}{\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}\sum}{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}}}$$
